# Supervised_Learning_Algorithms_FuelEmissionDataset

Supervised Learning Algorithms are used on "Car Fuel Consumptions and Emissions 2000-2013" dataset.
Some preprocessing  methods are used in order to use the dataset properly and after this,some metrics were used to count the evaluation of the model.
